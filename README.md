### Hi 😎 I'm Ben.

I’m a tech enthusiast who genuinely lives and breathes technology.

I currently work at Microsoft as a Senior Solutions Architect, where I focus on [Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us), GitHub, and AI technologies. My passion is helping teams learn, adopt, and scale modern AI workflows—using agents, MCPs, and intelligent automation—to turn ideas into real outcomes.

You’ll often see me using [Github Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot) in my demos. It dramatically accelerates my productivity and frees me up to focus on what matters most: solving complex problems and delivering impact. Buckle up—it’s going to be a fun ride 🚀



### Background:

I’m a cloud and infrastructure expert with over 18 years of experience, designing and delivering enterprise-scale solutions across hybrid cloud and on-premises environments.

At Microsoft, I lead Azure-driven innovation with a strong emphasis on AI enablement and developer productivity, leveraging platforms like GitHub to modernize how teams build, secure, and ship software.

My expertise spans system architecture, advanced networking, high-performance computing, virtualization, security, and private cloud. I’ve led large-scale transformation projects, helping organizations build secure, resilient, and scalable platforms for mission-critical workloads.

I’m also a strong advocate for developer experience and AI adoption, frequently delivering workshops, webinars, and talks on generative AI, DevSecOps, and cloud-native development—always with a focus on translating deep technical capabilities into tangible business value.

Over the years, I’ve contributed to numerous community initiatives, including workshops, hackathons, and technical events.
Previously, I founded OCIKB, a blog dedicated to Oracle Cloud Infrastructure, and led the local OCI community in my country.
